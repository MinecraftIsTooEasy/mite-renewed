This will be the last version of MiTE: Renewed to use the original Avernite version schema, and future releases will
adopt semantic versioning instead. The versioning scheme used has caused a bit of confusion, and I do not want to give
off the impression that this is an officially endorsed continuation. This project is an unofficial addon that attempts
to expand upon MiTE while trying to stay aligned with MiTE's design/difficulty. I only claim ownership over the work
I've done on this project. I apologize for the confusion (or for getting anyone's hopes up) regarding this project
