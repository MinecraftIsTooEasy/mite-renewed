# mite-renewed
Minecraft is Too Easy: Renewed is an extended development addon for MiTE via FishModLoader. The goal is to actively maintain and continue developing MiTE, elaborating on its current mechanics to provide richer progression and gameplay. The project tries to adhere to the intent of the mod author, Avernite; however, changes are being made to improve accessibility and widen the mod's appeal. **This is an unofficial continuation project, it has not been endorsed by Avernite. R196 is considered finalized by the original author and remains as the official latest version.**

# background
*Minecraft is Too Easy* is an old total conversion mod for Minecraft created by Avernite. The goal was to put a challenging spin on survival gameplay, with it's most striking features being the new mobs, dimensions, and how your stats scale with your current player level. It essentially turned Minecraft into a hardcore RPG survival adventure. It would be developed up until late 2017, where the mod's development concluded with it's last release being R196. MiTE is a fairly obscure mod in the western Minecraft community, but in China, MiTE was a very popular mod and continues to be to this day. 

After MiTE's development was concluded, many talented developers have come together to decompile and create mods and modloaders for MiTE. The current supported loader is a Fabric fork known as *FishModLoader*. Modern modding tools like Mixins are available for use, allowing for projects like this one to exist without needing to resort to making a base-edit. Renewed is the first major content addon to be developed by the western community, and will hopefully push MiTE to a wider western audience
